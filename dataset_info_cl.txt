The data comes as supplemetary material for the article:
Data from Predicting 30 Day Hospital Readmissions
https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/781670/

Challenge:
Determine if a discharged patient will return to a hospital within 30 days.

Emergency readmission to hospital is frequently used as a measure of the quality of a 
hospital because a high proportion of readmissions should be preventable if the preceding 
care is adequate. Hospitals are required to maintain rates of readmission below a national 
standard, else they face sanctions and fines. In this competition, we seek to predict whether 
a patient discharged from hospital will return within 30 days as an  emergency admit. We have 
data from two major hospitals with information on their emergency admissions. Data include 
demographic information, outcomes, all laboratory testing done while the patient is hospital 
for that admission. The features of the data are described in detail in the data description 
section. The accuracy measure for the models is classification accuracy as measured by the 
area under the ROC curve. The winner of the competition will be the team that is at the top 
of the private leaderboard. If you overfit your models to the training data and the public 
test data, they are likely to perform poorly on the private leaderboard.
